     * In theory the internal oscillator (clock) is 25MHz but it really isn't
     * that precise. You can 'calibrate' this by tweaking this number until
     * you get the PWM update frequency you're expecting!
     * The int.osc. for the PCA9685 chip is a range between about 23-27MHz and
     * is used for calculating things like writeMicroseconds()
     * Analog servos run at ~50 Hz updates, It is importaint to use an
     * oscilloscope in setting the int.osc frequency for the I2C PCA9685 chip.
     * 1) Attach the oscilloscope to one of the PWM signal pins and ground on
     *    the I2C PCA9685 chip you are setting the value for.
     * 2) Adjust setOscillatorFrequency() until the PWM update frequency is the
     *    expected value (50Hz for most ESCs)
     * Setting the value here is specific to each individual I2C PCA9685 chip and
     * affects the calculations for the PWM update frequency.
     * Failure to correctly set the int.osc value will cause unexpected PWM results
